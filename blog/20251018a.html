        <h1>Reach A-1000 again</h1>
            <p>If you guys play Roblox, you will know what is DOORS.</p>
            <p>If you play DOORS, you will know The Rooms.</p>
            <p>You will also know that it is the longest section in DOORS which takes at least 2 hours playing continuously for a regular player.</p>
            <p>And you know what? <a href="../media/blog/A-1000.png">I'VE JUST COMPLETED IT!</a></p>
            <p>Well, in fact, I've completed it twice. The first time in the 16th of July 2024, and this, the 18th of October 2025, is the second one.</p>
            <h2>Some tips you may find helpful</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A-90 usually spawns alongside A-60 or A-120, so it is recommended to not enter a locker until A-60 or A-120 comes nearby — if you enter too soon, A-90 may deals damage to you. Alternatively, if you locate a locker as soon as you enter the room, you can immediately enter it, stay there for some seconds and go out if (no A-90 spawns and) nothing happens.</li>
                <li>You should play alone, as other players may take your hiding spot, or interact with an exit door and make everyone leaves without others agreement, etc. Though, if you play with others, remember that anyone who dies can be revived if a player goes to or leaves The Rooms (or any floors).</li>
                <li>Catwalk (rooms that have stairs), Alternative Cubby (rooms that have a white board on the left), Lockers rooms (rooms where there are many lockers but most of them are unusable) are where A-60 and A-120 can spawn.</li>
