        <h1>Riots in South and South-East Asia</h1>
        <p>Apparently, many riots have occured in South and South-East Asia recently. The most remarkable examples are the Bangladeshi and Nepali revolts which changed the governments of these 2 countries.</p>
        <p>Well, as you can see, (almost) all of these riots are called &laquo;Gen-Z riots&raquo;, because of the amount of young people and students who join those riots.</p>
        <p>Many people say those riots mattered because they could change the corrupted governments in the countries, but many Vietnamese think these riots are just conspiracies of some other countries... Well, in my opinion, if those so-called revolutions can positively impact the goverments, then good, but I see many rioters are just vandalising things, which is terrible.</p>
        <p>Anyway, I'm in Vietnam, and there's no chance of this happening here, and I really hope it will never happen...</p>
        <p>A little irrelevant thing: It's been 3 weeks since I go to school again, and it SUCKS. And the worst thing is, it could've been better, IF THE TEACHER DIDN'T APPOINT ME TO AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE CLASS!!!1!!1!!11 (tôi là lớp phó học tập)</p>
