        <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Xin chào / Hello / Здравствуйте!</p>
            <p>My name is &laquo;Ngô Trần Quang Thiện&raquo; (Southern accent: /ŋo˧ ʈə̆ŋ˨˩ waŋ˧ tʰiŋ˨˩˨/ Ngoh Truhng Wahng Thing; Northern accent: /ŋo˧ tɕə̆n˨˩ kwaŋ˧ tʰiə̆n˨˩ˀ/ Ngoh Chuhn Kwong Tee-ehn).</p>
            <p>I'm a student who LOVES programming, which is why I'm here, with my random ideas.</p>
            <h2>Information about me</h2>
                <p>Some basic ones first:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I live in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.</li>
                    <li>I attend to a local school. I'm an excellent student by the way XD.</li>
                    <li>I'm kinda bad at art. Take a look! They are based on Cult of the Lamb characters.</li><img src="../media/blog/longrobe_transparent.png" alt="My OC, based on COTL" width="300" height="300" style="float:right">
                    <li>I also love some weird things. I had rather not say them.</li>
                    <li>I don't like replying unimportant messages, so if you email me and I reply, then you(r email) are really important.</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Information about my programming</h3>
                <p>I'm kind of fanatical about programming. My primary programming language is Python and JavaScript. I'm going to learn more languages!</p>
                <p>Also, I want to create arts about programming languages.</p>
                <p>I've created some Python modules. One of them is &laquo;countries-dictionary&raquo;. You can download it <a href="https://pypi.org/project/countries-dictionary/">here</a>. The module is also maintained in one of my GitHub repositories, it is <a href="https://github.com/ThienFakeVN/countries_dictionary">here</a>.</p>
            <h3>My languages</h3>
                <p>If you see the greetings at the start of the page, those are written in the 3 languages that I understand, they are arranged in order from my first language to the most recent one I have learnt:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Vietnamese: My native language, of course. I was born in the Southern of Vietnam so I usually use the Southern Vietnamese;</li>
                    <li>English: My second one, of course I have to learn it. I feel happy that I'm one of the people in Vietnam who are good at (basic) English, I still make mistakes though. I love using British English, and I have been carefully learning about the differences between American and British English so that I could use British English properly. I still sometimes use American, especially words and phrases which belong to Amercian English only;</li>
                    <li>Russian: I love Russia, so that's why I'm learning their language. (WAITTT! I love Russia doesn't mean I support their war in Ukraine! I still hope that they will make peace)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By the way, shall we translate this romantic sentence into these languages? (Note that in different contexts, the translation would be different)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Vietnamese: &laquo;Tôi yêu em.&raquo;</li>
                    <li>English: &laquo;I love you.&raquo;</li>
                    <li>Russian: &laquo;Я тебя люблю.&raquo;</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>My intentions</h2>
                <p>I have a lot of intentions, let's see...</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make games! Of course a person who learns progamming would make game;</li>
                    <li>Learn more languages;</li>
                    <li>Make arts, I've mentioned it earlier;</li>
                    <li>etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I still have more intentions, but I had rather not say them, because I don't want people to use my ideas, well...</p>
            <h2>Anyway...</h2>
                <p>...This is my first post, I posted it at midnight.</p>
                <p>I will make blog posts about about recent events in my life or topics that interest me. I will also edit posted posts sometimes.</p>
                <p>I hope you guys (are going to) have a good day!</p>
