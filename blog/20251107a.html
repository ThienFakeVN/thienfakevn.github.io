            <p>Xin chào / Hello / Здравствуйте!</p>
            <p>This is my first report of NNN 2025.</p>
            <p>So everything is kinda okay at the moment. Well, such a shame that I've found a lot of... uhhh... &laquo;documents&raquo; to do that &laquo;go-on&raquo;ing job.</p>
            <p>Everyday has been divided into two sections: in the morning till the afternoon, I've got plenty of things to do, especially that... I go to school yeah so I don't have much time to think about other things; in or after the evening however, I have a lot of free time (actually I still have a lot of things to do but I don't really give them a shit), and in those moments, some &laquo;forbidden things to say&raquo; kick in.</p>
            <p>And you know what's worse? Saturdays and Sundays are full of free time...</p>
            <p>If you are also doing this challenge, you should fill your free time with stuff to do, stop using phone at night particularly and go to sleep early generally, since you can think of sexual things when you have free time, attractive things can appear when you use your phone (especially when you're on social media) and night is the time you are likely to goon.</p>
            <p>There are lots of things you can do to distract yourself from forbidden thoughts. You may do things that you like, such as learning (programming) languages or performing them, the same as how I'm writing these lines (yeah I know HTML isn't a programming languages but who cares) or writing this Russian sentence: &laquo;Такой хороший день без сексуальной мыслей... я не чувствую себя хорошо.&raquo; (well I'm not that good at Russian and I really need help from dictionaries and Google Translate but well who cares I do that with English anyway)</p>
            <p>Alternatively, you can learn about other things, like ideologies, you should try to find yourself a ideology like Democratic Socialism it's really cool. There's still more, you can consider learning the Qurʾān to become a Muslim, or reading the Communist Manifesto to revolt against the government, OR GIVING MEIN KAMPF A SHOT TO @#$@#$%%, etc. To conclude, do whatever you can to not think of... y'know.</p>
            <p>Anyway, congrats, you have survived for 7 days, 23 days left...</p>
            <p>(And by the way the 4th <i>Random stuffs</i> is going to be dropped in December)</p>
