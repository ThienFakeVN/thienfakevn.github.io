        <h1>Random stuffs 4th</h1>
            <p>Xin chào / Hello / Здравствуйте!</p>
            <p>Welcome to the fourth <i>Random stuffs</i> post! This is the <i>Random stuffs</i> post of November 2025.</p>
            <p>Well, this time it's going to be kind of short. Sorry, I don't have much thing to say.</p>
            <p>So, I've lost NNN on 17th November. Dammit.</p>
            <p>Also, I've been having some little bad test results recently, only in Literature though, but considering that's a major and important subject... I've just done a Literature test few hours ago by the way, it wasn't gone very well.</p>
            <p>Ok, so what’s the date today? Hmm... it's 1st December apparently. Well, that's mean there're like 31 days left before 2026. Heh, haven't seen anyone saying &laquo;2026 will be my year&raquo; recently. Everyone's a bit terrified, aren't they?</p>
