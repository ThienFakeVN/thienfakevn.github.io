        <h1>Vietnamese educational system and schools (not full)</h1>
            <p>In the first <i>Random stuffs</i> post, I said that I would make another post about Vietnamese schools. And here it is!</p>
            <p>This post focuses on the educational system (like subjects, grades, etc.) of Vietnam and interesting things in Vietnamese schools.</p>
            <h2>Roles in class</h2>
                <p>In the beginning of a academic year, the teacher will appoint some students as monitors. There are one head monitor and few more vice-manitors who are resopnsible for class' learning, discipline, chores, etc. Also, the class will be divided into 4 (or 3) groups, and each group will have a leader. Group leaders are also monitors.</p>
                <p>And here's a fun fact: no one wants to be a monitor. Why? Being a monitor means you take responsibility of the class, or one of its affair or group, and that sucks, yeah.</p>
            <h2>Grades, tests/exams and academic achievements</h2>
                <p>There are 4 types of tests in Vietnamese educational system, all of them have their own kind of grade.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Regular/mini/15-mins test (Kiểm tra thường xuyên/15 phút) — Regular grade (Điểm thường xuyên)</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Regular tests are the most common tests. In some subjects, regular tests are simple and unexpected, students just need a paper, the teacher will write questions and problems on the board and students have 15 minutes to solve them in their self-prepared paper. In some other subjects, students will be informed about the test days, or even weeks before the test, students will have test paper given by the teacher, the questions are on the papers and students have 20 minutes or more. Grades received from regular tests are regular grades.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Mid-term/45-mins test/exam (Kiểm tra giữa kỳ/45 phút) — Mid-term grade (Điểm giữa kỳ)</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mid-term tests are special. Mid-term exams of Maths, English, History&Geography, and Hoạt động Trải nghiệm (no translation) will be taken on the first lessons on Mondays of the 4 weeks in the middle of a term. Other subjects' mid-term tests are similar to regular tests, except that you will have more time to do the test. Grades received from mid-term tests/exams are mid-term grades.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>End-of-term exam (kiểm tra cuối kỳ) — End-of-term grade (Điểm cuối kỳ)</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>End-of-term exams... the hardest ones... In some minor subjects, exams will be taken on the first lessons, kind of similar to mid-term exams. The other subjects' exams, however, are... difficult to explain. Exams will be taken either in the smorning or in the afternoons. If students take exams in the morning, they won't need to go to school in the afternoon and vice versa. The exams also will be organised, like those IELTS tests. Grades received from end-of-term exams are end-of-term grades.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Bonus grade (Điểm miệng) which you can receive by various ways</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There are a lot of ways to receive bonus grades, I will not tell them here bruh. They are usually treated as regular grades</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
                <p>The average grade of a student in a subject in a term is calculated like this (this is just what I know):</p>
                <p>$$\frac{\underbrace{RT_1 + RT_2 + \ldots}_{n} + MT \cdot 2 + EE \cdot 3}{n + 2 + 3}$$</p>
                <p>RTs are regular grades, MT is the mid-term grade, EE is the end-of-term exam, and n is the number of regular grades</p>
                <p>By the way, the Vietnamese grades are marked from 0 to 10.</p>
                <p>Well, that's almost all! I will write more whenever I have more infomation.</p>
